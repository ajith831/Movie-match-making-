Delivering Personalized Movie Recommendations with an AI-Driven Matchmaking System

Overview

This project focuses on developing a personalized movie recommendation system powered by artificial intelligence and matchmaking algorithms. By understanding user preferences and movie characteristics, the system intelligently pairs users with movies they are most likely to enjoy, creating a highly personalized entertainment experience.

Features

User Profile Modeling: Captures user preferences through behavior analysis and explicit feedback.

Movie Metadata Processing: Analyzes genres, cast, director, ratings, reviews, and more.

AI-Driven Matchmaking Engine: Matches users to movies using machine learning and recommendation algorithms.

Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies tailored to each user's unique taste.

Continuous Learning: Adapts and improves recommendations based on user interactions over time.


Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (optional if deep learning used)

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Database: SQLite / MongoDB (optional)

APIs: TMDB API (for movie data)

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask (for demo app)

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system


2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the application:

python app/main.py



How It Works

The system gathers user preferences via survey forms or past interactions.

Movies are processed and categorized based on metadata features.

The AI matchmaking model computes compatibility scores between users and movies.

Top recommended movies are presented to the user through a simple and intuitive interface.


Future Enhancements

Integrate social media behavior analysis.

Add deep learning-based natural language understanding for better review analysis.

Expand to TV shows and web series.

Enable real-time recommendations.
