Data Visualization â€“ Before and After Processing

To understand the impact of data preprocessing on model performance, we created a visual comparative analysis using histograms and bar charts. The visualization is divided into two stages: before processing and after processing.

Before Processing:

Raw data often contains inconsistencies such as varied scales, skewed distributions, and missing values.

We focused on key numeric features: Rating, PeopleVote, Hero_Rating, movie_rating, and content_rating.

Histograms were plotted to show the original distribution of each feature. These visuals revealed the varying scales and non-uniform distributions, which could potentially affect machine learning model performance.


After Processing:

We applied Min-Max normalization to rescale the numeric features between 0 and 1.

The same histograms were then generated for the normalized data.

The post-processing visualizations showed a consistent and scaled distribution, making the data more suitable for training AI models.


Visual Tools Used:

Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to generate the plots.

Each variable was plotted side-by-side (original vs. normalized) to clearly observe the transformation.


This visual representation demonstrates the importance of preprocessing for effective AI-driven matchmaking and ensures a fair weighting of features when recommending movies.
